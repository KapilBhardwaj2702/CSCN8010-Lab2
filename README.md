# CSCN8010-Lab2: Diabetes Prediction & Regression Models

This project explores various supervised machine learning models to predict disease progression in diabetes patients using the Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset. It covers univariate and multivariate regression techniques, decision trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), with evaluation based on RÂ², MAE, and MAPE.
