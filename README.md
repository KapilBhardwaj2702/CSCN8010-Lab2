# Diabetes Prediction & Regression Models

This project explores various supervised machine learning models to predict disease progression in diabetes patients using the [Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset). It covers univariate and multivariate regression techniques, decision trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), with evaluation based on R², MAE, and MAPE.
